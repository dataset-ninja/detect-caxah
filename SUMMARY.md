**Detect (caxah)** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 19 images with 316 labeled objects belonging to 22 different classes including *CCLD:1-2*, *Coax-Cable*, *Electric-Cable*, and other: *Pole_Height*, *SLP*, *Wooden-Pole*, *Diameter*, *Lowest Point of Attachment on Pole*, *EQLD:1-1*, *Lowest Point of Attachment on Strand*, *Fiber-Equipment*, *CCLD:2-3*, *CCLD:3-4*, *Street-Light*, *CCLD:4-5*, *CCLD:5-6*, *EQLD:1-2*, *EQLD:1-3*, *Telco-Cable*, *Amplifier*, *EQLD:1-4*, and *Car_Overlap*.

Each image in the Detect (caxah) dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (3 images), *valid* (5 images), and *train* (11 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/s-o33ou).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
